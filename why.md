# Why

I started having problems with the HyperX Pulsefire Core mouse on Void Linux,
after the first click the mouse stopped responding. After some time the only
solution I found was to remove and put the USB in. Because it was very
uncomfortable to do this every time I turned on the PC,
and that made me develop the usb-reset.

Hope it is useful for you too 👍
